Two MLPs were trained using back-propogation as
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generative Model G
    \item Discriminative Model D
\end{itemize}

The Generative Model captures data distribution.
The Discriminative Model estimates the probability that a sample is from trained data or not.

\textbf{Ideal Result}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item G could generate the data in trained set
    \item D equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ ( so that it cannot determine whether the generated data is from trained set or not)
\end{itemize}
